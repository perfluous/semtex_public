# SEMTEX RETURNED.

# SEMTEX
SEMTEX is one of several overarching projects. It aims to combine several large semi-unrelated projects into a converging system.
Several projects aim to create research services and/or new markets. Others aim to increase quality of life in general. And then there are the fun mind-blowing projects.
For example, specifically aiming for an increase in neuroplasticity, dopamine release, androgenic activity, and adaptogenic effects. While at the same time being anticarcinogtic, anti-infammatory.
This will then be marketed together with \<PROPRIETARY\> to create a demand for \<PROPRIETARY\>. This in turn will increase supplement testing, and bring a cheap way for people to masure their current health status. Which will bring a huge boost in (anonymised) health data.
This would allow research into the effectiveness and amount of producable \<REDACTED\> via its precursor  and could possibly be combined with the extraction of the former, increasing the yield.

This is a huge project and before anything else I must generate income for the server, production materials, complete AutoGen and dotfiles (semtex-spikelr). From this the projects' work requirements will plateau. The cost of IP generation will reduce significantly, most projects and post-projects will be easily automated.

## SEMTEX: M2B
Mushroom cultivation, pro-biotics brewing. Will in the future become an automated system.
Starts with selling mushrooms, wil grow towards extracting supplemental, medicinal, and \<REDACTED\> compounds.
This will be subdivided into multiple projects once the precice plans are there.
> Currently there are:
> - documents
>   - growtypes
>   - compounds
>   - brewing specifics
>   - etc
> - CAD files
> - partial P&ID
> - Market analysis
> - Materials for production start (minus ~â‚¬5k)

> Base requirements for physical automization start (birdseye view):
> - Supply Chain Management
> - Legal
> - Operations
> - Food Safety
> - Environmental Management
> - Quality Assurance
> - Research And Development
> - IT
> - Finance
> - Engineering
> - Project Management
> - Marketing

## SEMTEX: ROME
### CM
Aims to gather historical data from local sources. First from local sources and later, European sources. The plan is to implement a (currently testing) system which will insentanvice historians and hobbyists to transcribe their found documents cheaply and easily.
Unlike Transkribus, this data will be made public and open-source.
This will then be added to vector database (ChromaDB), which will be attached to the CM LLM. Once a proper error rate has been achieved, it will be published together with the data source to aid in research for resaerchers, hobbyists, and professionals.
Here a test with AutoGen will be run in order to test the feasability of a later project.
